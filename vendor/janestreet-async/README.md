"Async"
=======

`Async` is a library for asynchronous programming, i.e., programming where some
part of the program must wait for things that happen at times determined by
some external entity (like a human or another program). This includes pretty
much any program that uses blocking calls (e.g., networking code, disk access),
timeouts, or event loops (e.g., GUIs).
