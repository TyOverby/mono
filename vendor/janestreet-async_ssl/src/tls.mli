  (** [wrap_client_connection] will immediately tear down the connection as soon as [f]
      returns. This doesn't accommodate cases where ['res] contains more [Async]
      primitives, such as a [Pipe.Reader.t]. [wrap_client_connection_and_stay_open]
      gives callers the agency to control when this teardown occurs.

      Callers must ensure that [`Do_not_close_until] becomes determined to avoid leaking
      file descriptors. The [unit Deferred.t] returned in [`Do_not_close_until] is also
      returned in [`Connection_closed] in case functions external to
      [wrap_client_connection_and_stay_open] care whether the TLS session has been torn
      down.

      It is an error to access the [Reader.t]/[Writer.t] once [`Do_not_close_until] has
      become determined (doing so may result in weird IO errors).
