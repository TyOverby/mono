(* One needs to be careful around Async Readers and Writers that share the same underyling
   file descriptor, which is something that happens when they're used for sockets.

   Closing the Reader before the Writer will cause the Writer to throw and complain about
   its underlying file descriptor being closed. This is why instead of using Reader.pipe
   directly below, we write out an equivalent version which will first close the Writer
   before closing the Reader once the input pipe is fully consumed.

   Additionally, [Writer.pipe] will not close the writer if the pipe is closed, so in
   order to avoid leaking file descriptors, we allow the pipe 30 seconds to flush before
   closing the writer. *)
