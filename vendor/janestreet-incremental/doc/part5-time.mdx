# Incremental tutorial, Part 5; Time

The goal of Incremental is to let you write code that looks a lot like
a naive, all-at-once implementation, but that behaves more like a
hand-tuned incremental version.  But this can be a tricky thing to do,
particularly for computations that depend on the current time in a
serious way.

Let's look at a concrete example: computing staleness.  We'll assume
we have a collection of services that are configured to start and stop
at particular times, and we want to compute the set of servers that
should be down, but are in fact still running.

First, let's start by modeling out some types for this example.

```ocaml
open Core
module Time_ns = Time_ns_unix
module Service_id : Identifiable = String
module Service_status = struct
  type t =
    { id : Service_id.t
    ; start_time: Time_ns.t
    ; stop_time: Time_ns.t option
    ; is_running: bool
    } [@@deriving fields]
end
```

Now, let's try to write a function that computes the set of services
that should have stopped, but that appear to be running nonetheless.
Here's an all-at-once implementation:

```ocaml
# let should_have_stopped services ~grace_period ~now =
    Map.filter services ~f:(fun (si:Service_status.t) ->
      match si.stop_time with
      | None -> false
      | Some stop_time ->
        let threshold = Time_ns.add stop_time grace_period in
        si.is_running && Time_ns.(>) now threshold)
val should_have_stopped :
  ('a, Service_status.t, 'b) Map.t ->
  grace_period:Time_ns.Span.t ->
  now:Time_ns.t -> ('a, Service_status.t, 'b) Map.t = <fun>
```

Now, let's try to create an incremental version of this, where the map
of service infos and the `now` are both passed in as incrementals.
First, let's set up Incremental.

```ocaml
module Incr = Incremental.Make ()
module Incr_map = Incr_map.Make(Incr)
open Incr.Let_syntax
```

And now, we can define the incremental version.

```ocaml
# let should_have_stopped services ~grace_period ~now =
    Incr_map.filter_mapi' services ~f:(fun ~key:_ ~data:(si:Service_status.t Incr.t) ->
      let%map si = si and now = now in
      match si.stop_time with
      | None -> None
      | Some stop_time ->
        let threshold = Time_ns.add stop_time grace_period in
        if si.is_running && Time_ns.(>) now threshold then Some si else None)
val should_have_stopped :
  ('a, Service_status.t, 'b) Map.t Incr.t ->
  grace_period:Time_ns.Span.t ->
  now:Time_ns.t Incr.t -> ('a, Service_status.t, 'b) Map.t Incr.t = <fun>
```

This looks incremental, but it isn't, really.  True, when the map of
status changes, you only have to do work for the specific service
statuses that have been updated.  But when the time changes, every
incremental in the map refires.  And time changes a lot!

Incremental's built-in support for time-based computations can help.
To use it, we first need to get our hands on an Incremental clock,
which is an imperative data structure that you can feed the current
time to.

```ocaml
# let clock =
    Incr.Clock.create ()
      ~start:(Time_ns.of_string "2019-01-01 00:00:00")
val clock : Incr.Clock.t = <abstr>
```

You can ask a clock for an incremental that gives you the current
time:

```ocaml
# let now = Incr.Clock.watch_now clock
val now : Time_ns.t Incr.t = <abstr>
```

But that's hard to use efficiently, since `now` is always changing.  A
better thing to use is `Incr.Clock.at`, which creates an incremental
whose value flips from `Before` to `After` when a particular threshold
time is hit.  Thus, you can write:

```ocaml
# let before_or_after =
    Incr.observe
      (Incr.Clock.at clock (Time_ns.of_string "2019-01-01 11:00:00"))
val before_or_after : Incr.Before_or_after.t Incr.Observer.t = <abstr>
```

As you can see below, the value of this incremental starts out as
`Before`:

```ocaml
# let show () =
    Incr.stabilize ();
    print_s [%sexp (Incr.Observer.value_exn before_or_after : Incr.Before_or_after.t)];;
val show : unit -> unit = <fun>
# let () = show ()
Before
```

But if we advance the time, we'll see it change to `After`.

```ocaml
# let () =
    Incr.Clock.advance_clock clock
      ~to_:(Time_ns.of_string "2019-01-01 11:00:01");
    show ()
After
```

There's an efficient implementation of this under the covers.  Instead
of each `Incr.Clock.at` having to be updated every time the clock is
advanced, we store the time at which the `Incr.Clock.at` needs to
change in a `Timing_wheel.t`, which is an efficient, time-sorted
queue.  That way, updating each incremental returned by
`Incr.Clock.at` is really inexpensive.

Let's see how we can use `Incr.Clock.at` to make a more efficient
implementation of `should_have_stopped`.

```ocaml
# let should_have_stopped clock services ~grace_period =
    Incr_map.filter_mapi' services ~f:(fun ~key:_ ~data:(si:Service_status.t Incr.t) ->
      let%bind si = si in
      match si.is_running, si.stop_time with
      | false, _ | _, None -> return None
      | _, Some stop_time ->
        match%map Incr.Clock.at clock (Time_ns.add stop_time grace_period) with
        | Before -> None
        | After -> Some si)
val should_have_stopped :
  Incr.Clock.t ->
  ('a, Service_status.t, 'b) Map.t Incr.t ->
  grace_period:Time_ns.Span.t -> ('a, Service_status.t, 'b) Map.t Incr.t =
  <fun>
```

Note the use of `bind` and `return` here. Despite our earlier
exhortations to be careful about using these functions, these uses are
reasonable because we're only doing a small amount of work on the
right-hand side of the bind.


And the overall computation has good incremental performance relative
to time changes.  In particular, the `Incr.Clock.at` nodes don't
update every time the clock advances, but only when the clock crosses
the appropriate time threshold.
