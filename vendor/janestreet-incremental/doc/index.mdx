# An Introduction to Incremental

Incremental is a tool for optimizing the /incremental performance/ of
your code. In other words, incremental makes it easier to build
computations that update efficiently when their input data changes in
small ways.

It's a useful tool, but one that a lot of people don't feel entirely
comfortable with.  It's also a tool that's easy to misuse, which can
leave you with confusing code and hard-to-predict behavior.

But all in, if you know how to approach it, Incremental is powerful,
and can simplify certain tasks immensely.

This guide will give you an overview of the library, explaining what
kinds of problems Incremental can help with, and some tips for making
the most out of it.

The tutorial is broken up into parts:

- [Preliminaries](./part1-preliminaries.mdx) covers what Incremental
  is for, and walks through the basics.
- [Dynamic computations with bind](./part2-dynamic.mdx) shows you
  how to use `bind` to build computations whose structure changes
  dynamically over time.
- [Incr_map](./part3-map.mdx) shows you how to use the `Incr_map`
  libraries to build efficient computations on `Map.t`'s.
- [Pitfalls](./part4-pitfalls.mdx) highlights some of the mistakes
  people typically make when first using Incremental.
- [Time](./part5-time.mdx) demonstrates Incremental's support for
  building computations over time.
- [Patterns](./part6-patterns.mdx) covers `ppx_pattern_bind`,
  which provides specialized support for doing incremental
  computations involving pattern matches.
- [Performance and optimization](./part7-optimization.mdx) has some
  notes on how to think about performance of your incremental
  programs.
- [Sharing](./part8-sharing.mdx) shows you how to optimize your
  incremental programs further by sharing sub-computations among
  different parts of your computation.
