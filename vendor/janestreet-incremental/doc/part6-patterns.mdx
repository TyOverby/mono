# Incremental tutorial, Part 6; Patterns

As we've already seen, using Incremental with pattern matching can
have some unexpected consequences.  For example, if you use record
patterns to deconstruct a given value, you might end up with more
dependencies than you expected.  Here's an example demonstrating this
from [part 1](./part1-preliminaries.mdx).

```ocaml
open Core
module Time_ns = Time_ns_unix
module Unix = Core_unix
module Incr = Incremental.Make ()
module Incr_map = Incr_map.Make (Incr);;
open Incr.Let_syntax;;

type z =
  { a: int list
  ; b: (int * int)
  }
[@@deriving fields]
```

```ocaml
# let sumproduct z =
    let a_prod =
      let%map { a; _ } = z in
      List.fold ~init:1 ~f:( * ) a
    in
    let b_prod =
      let%map {b = (b1,b2); _ } = z in
      b1 * b2
    in
    let%map a_prod = a_prod and b_prod = b_prod in
    a_prod + b_prod
val sumproduct : z Incr.t -> int Incr.t = <fun>
```

In the above code, it looks like the computation of `a_prod` and
`b_prod` are independent, and so modifying just `a` should only cause
`a_prod` to be recomputed, and modifying just `b` should only cause
`b_prod` to be recomputed.

But in reality, both computations depend on `z`, which means that
whenever `z` changes, they'll both be rerun.

We can make this better by introducing an intermediate incremental
that includes just the value that `a_prod` requires (i.e., `a`), and
having `a_prod` depend just on that (and similarly for `b_prod` and
`b`).  Here's what that code looks like:

```ocaml
# let sumproduct z =
    let a_prod =
      let%map a = z >>| a in
      List.fold ~init:1 ~f:( * ) a
    in
    let b_prod =
      let%map (b1,b2) = z >>| b in
      b1 * b2
    in
    let%map a_prod = a_prod and b_prod = b_prod in
    a_prod + b_prod
val sumproduct : z Incr.t -> int Incr.t = <fun>
```

This is a common enough idiom that it's useful to have some direct
support for it in the case of pattern matching.  We have that support
in the form of a syntax extension called `ppx_pattern_bind`.  Using
`ppx_pattern_bind`, we can write:

```ocaml
# let sumproduct z =
    let a_prod =
      let%pattern_map { a; _ } = z in
      List.fold ~init:1 ~f:( * ) a
    in
    let b_prod =
      let%pattern_map {b = (b1,b2); _ } = z in
      b1 * b2
    in
    let%map a_prod = a_prod and b_prod = b_prod in
    a_prod + b_prod
val sumproduct : z Incr.t -> int Incr.t = <fun>
```

Now, the dependencies are as they should be, with `a_prod` only firing
when `a` changes, and `b_prod` only firing when `b1` or `b2` changes.
That's because `%pattern_map` automatically constructs the necessary
projection function to extract the variables in question from the
pattern, and then adds the appropriate intermediate incrementals based
on those projection functions.

This is pretty convenient when it comes to product types, like tuples
and records; but it really shines when you start dealing with sum
types, e.g., variants.

Consider the following somewhat contrived example.  Imagine that we
have a text-based UI that can be in one of two different states;
either it's showing a set of hosts, or its showing a collection of
services, and in either case, we want to generate a textual
representation of the subset of those services that are in a failed
state.

First, let's put together some types.

```ocaml
# module Status = struct
    type t = | Healthy
             | Failed of { as_of : Time_ns.t }
  end
module Status : sig type t = Healthy | Failed of { as_of : Time_ns.t; } end
# module Hostname : Identifiable = String
module Hostname : Core.Identifiable
# module Host = struct
    type t = { addr: Unix.Inet_addr.t
             ; status : Status.t
             }
  end
module Host :
  sig type t = { addr : UnixLabels.inet_addr; status : Status.t; } end
# module Service = struct
    module Id : Identifiable = String
    type t = { host : Hostname.t
             ; status : Status.t
             }
  end
module Service :
  sig
    module Id : Core.Identifiable
    type t = { host : Hostname.t; status : Status.t; }
  end
# module Model = struct
    type t = | Host_view of Host.t Map.M(Hostname).t
             | Service_view of Service.t Map.M(Service.Id).t
  end
module Model :
  sig
    type t =
        Host_view of Host.t Core.Map.M(Hostname).t
      | Service_view of Service.t Core.Map.M(Service.Id).t
  end
```

Now, let's write out some plausible looking incremental code for
generating the view of failed hosts or services.  First, let's write
incremental view functions that handle the host view and service view
separately.

```ocaml
# let view_failed (type a) (module M : Stringable with type t = a) get_status map =
    let failed =
      Incr_map.filter_mapi map ~f:(fun ~key:_ ~data ->
        match (get_status data : Status.t) with
        | Healthy -> None
        | Failed _ -> Some data)
    in
    let%map failed = failed in
    Map.keys failed
    |> List.map ~f:M.to_string
    |> String.concat ~sep:"\n"
val view_failed :
  (module Core.Stringable with type t = 'a) ->
  ('b -> Status.t) -> ('a, 'b, 'c) Map.t Incr.t -> string Incr.t = <fun>
# let view_failed_hosts hosts =
    view_failed (module Hostname) (fun (host:Host.t) -> host.status) hosts
val view_failed_hosts :
  (Hostname.t, Host.t, 'a) Map.t Incr.t -> string Incr.t = <fun>
# let view_failed_services services =
    view_failed (module Service.Id) (fun (service:Service.t) -> service.status) services
val view_failed_services :
  (Service.Id.t, Service.t, 'a) Map.t Incr.t -> string Incr.t = <fun>
```

Now, the question comes of how we weave them together.  Here's a first attempt.

```ocaml
# let view (model : Model.t Incr.t) =
    match%map model with
    | Host_view hosts -> view_failed_hosts hosts
    | Service_view services -> view_failed_services services
Line 3, characters 44-49:
Error: This expression has type
         Host.t Core.Map.M(Hostname).t =
           (Hostname.t, Host.t, Hostname.comparator_witness) Map.t
       but an expression was expected of type
         (Hostname.t, Host.t, 'a) Map.t Incr.t =
           ((Hostname.t, Host.t, 'a) Map.t, Incr.state_witness) Incremental.t
```

But this doesn't type-check, because once we do the pattern match, we
no longer have an incremental value to feed to `view_failed_hosts` and
`view_failed_services`.  In particular, now `hosts` and `services` are
ordinary, non-incremental values.  Even if we try to fix this by
using `return` to convert those values into incremental, it still
doesn't do the right thing.

```ocaml
# let view (model : Model.t Incr.t) =
    match%map model with
    | Host_view hosts -> view_failed_hosts (return hosts)
    | Service_view services -> view_failed_services (return services)
val view : Model.t Incr.t -> string Incr.t Incr.t = <fun>
```

In particular, it has the wrong return type, having an extra level of
incrementality.  We can fix this by using bind instead of map.

```ocaml
# let view (model : Model.t Incr.t) =
    match%bind model with
    | Host_view hosts -> view_failed_hosts (return hosts)
    | Service_view services -> view_failed_services (return services)
val view : Model.t Incr.t -> string Incr.t = <fun>
```

But while this has the right type, it has the entirely wrong
incremental performance.  In particular, every time the model changes,
the entire computation is redone from scratch.  That's the case even
if the actual change is very small; say, a single entry added into the
`hosts` view.

Happily, `ppx_pattern_bind` can help us here as well.  We can rewrite
the above example as follows.

```ocaml
# let view (model : Model.t Incr.t) =
    match%pattern_bind model with
    | Host_view hosts -> view_failed_hosts hosts
    | Service_view services -> view_failed_services services
val view : Model.t Incr.t -> string Incr.t = <fun>
```

Note that the variables `hosts` and `services` that were bound as
ordinary variables on the left-hand side of the arrow are treated as
incremental variables on the right hand side.

And now, the incremental performance is good.  The idea here is that
the full computation is only rerun in when we switch between cases
(e.g., from `Host_view` to `Service_view`), but when we stay within
the same case of the pattern match, we are effectively mapping over an
incremental of the data contained therein.

To get a better sense of how this actually works, let's think about
what the above example actually desugars into.  It's something like
the following.

```ocaml
# type model_kind = Host_view | Service_view;;
type model_kind = Host_view | Service_view
# let view (model : Model.t Incr.t) =
    let model_kind : model_kind Incr.t =
      match%map model with
      | Host_view _ -> Host_view
      | Service_view _ -> Service_view
    in
    match%bind model_kind with
    | Host_view ->
      let hosts =
        match%map model with
        | Host_view x -> x
        | Service_view _ -> assert false
      in
      view_failed_hosts hosts
    | Service_view ->
      let services =
        match%map model with
        | Service_view x -> x
        | Host_view _ -> assert false
      in
      view_failed_services services
val view : Model.t Incr.t -> string Incr.t = <fun>
```

This makes the performance behavior a little more explicit. The code
is effectively binding on the constructor tag alone first, and then
doing a map over the data thus obtained.
