# Incremental tutorial, Part 4; Pitfalls

Incremental is really useful, sometimes making it massively easier to
write your program in a way that's easy to understand and reasonably
performant.

But Incremental also has a number of pitfalls -- mistakes that are all
too easy to make, especially when you're new to the library. Here are
some suggestions to help you avoid those mistakes.

## Don't over-incrementalize

When people first start using Incremental, they think of it as being
something they can sprinkle costlessly throughout their program to
improve its performance.  This is far from the truth. Incremental
nodes themselves are expensive to construct, expensive to fire, and
take up a lot of memory.  To be clear, they're not *that* expensive;
you can fire millions of incremental nodes per second. But they're
still orders of magnitude more expensive than a simple addition.

So, when optimizing with Incremental, try to do so in a way that is
mindful of the cost of an incremental node.  And make a point of
benchmarking your code so you can tell if your changes are making
things better or worse.

## Don't use mutable state, especially not for capturing history

For a functional programming shop, we do an awful lot of imperative
programming, and mostly, there's nothing wrong with that.  But
Incremental programs are much easier to understand if you avoid
imperative state religiously.

In particular, the mental model you should bring to writing an
Incremental computation is that of optimizing a pure computation over
pure data.  At its core, Incremental operates by allowing you to
compare new versions of your computation to old ones.  Using mutable
data undermines this in fairly fundamental ways.

People will sometimes use imperative state to capture the history of
an incremental computation, allowing you to record and depend on
previous things that were computed. Beware! This is surprisingly
tricky to reason about. Incremental is very careful not to do
unnecessary computations, which means that it's hard to predict which
parts of an incremental computation will actually be run on any given
stabilization.  As a result, putting effects in the right hand side of
a bind or map to capture historical information is going to be
confusing.

It's generally better to capture historical data in variables at the
edge of your incremental computation, rather than in the middle of it.

## Be wary of `bind` (and especially `return`)

Incremental has both `map`-like operations (including `map2`, `map3`,
etc), which allow you to build static dependency graphs, and `bind`,
which lets you build dynamic graphs, where dependencies can change
and new hunks of graph can be created in the course of a computation.

`bind` is powerful, but it's also problematic.  It's all too easy to
create a computation using `bind` that looks incremental at first
glance, but in reality just recreates the entire computation graph any
time anything changes.  This is worse than useless, giving you a
massively slower program and zero incrementality.

Let's start off with an example showing how to use `bind` in a
reasonable way, and then show some examples that use it unreasonably.

First, the reasonable example.  Consider the following function for
filtering a map based on an incremental search string.  First, let's
set up our environment and instantiate Incremental

```ocaml
# open Core
# module Incr = Incremental.Make ()
module Incr : Incremental.S
# open Incr.Let_syntax
```

And, we'll instantiate `Incr_map` as well.

```ocaml
module Incr_map = Incr_map.Make(Incr);;
```

And here's the actual filter function.

```ocaml
# let filter_key_by_string map pattern =
    let%bind pattern = pattern in
    Incr_map.filter_mapi map ~f:(fun ~key ~data ->
      if String.Search_pattern.matches pattern key then Some data else None)
val filter_key_by_string :
  (string, 'a, 'b) Map.t Incr.t ->
  String.Search_pattern.t Incr.t -> (string, 'a, 'b) Map.t Incr.t = <fun>
```

Now, let's think for a moment about the incremental performance of
this computation.  When the map changes, `Incr_map.filter_mapi` will
only do work proportional to the number of changes to the map, rather
than rescanning the entire map on each change.

But when the pattern changes, the entire computation will be redone
from scratch, in a non-incremental fashion.

For many applications, this is fine. The pattern will change rarely,
and when it does, a rescan of the full data is hard to beat in the
general case.

This example shows both the power and the peril of `bind`. It lets you
write things that are otherwise hard to express, but it does so in a
way that can be quite expensive.

Basically, `bind` can make sense in two cases:

- First, if the scope of what's recomputed on the right-hand side is
  really small, so it doesn't matter that it's non-incremental.
- Second, if the left hand side changes rarely enough that doing the
  full recomputation on the right hand side isn't a problem.

Using `bind` in other cases is almost always a mistake.  And just
converting an example that uses `map` into a seemingly equivalent one
that uses binds is pretty much always a mistake.  Consider the
following simple example from [part 1](./part1-preliminaries.mdx):

```ocaml
# let sum x y z =
    let%map x = x and y = y and z = z in
    x +. y +. z
val sum : float Incr.t -> float Incr.t -> float Incr.t -> float Incr.t =
  <fun>
```

We could have rendered this as follows:

```ocaml
# let sum x y z =
    let%bind x = x in
    let%bind y = y in
    let%bind z = z in
    return (x +. y +. z)
val sum : float Incr.t -> float Incr.t -> float Incr.t -> float Incr.t =
  <fun>
```

While it has the same signature, the second `sum` has much worse
performance, needing to allocate new incrementals every time any input
changes.

Here's another example of Incremental gone wrong.  Imagine we want to
use our filter function above on a model that contains both the
pattern and data.  Here's the definition of the model:

```ocaml
type model = { pattern: String.Search_pattern.t
             ; data: int Map.M(String).t
             }
[@@deriving fields];;
```

And here's a way of filtering the model based on the pattern.

```ocaml
# let filter_model m =
    let%bind m = m in
    filter_key_by_string (return m.data) (return m.pattern)
val filter_model :
  model Incr.t -> (string, int, String.comparator_witness) Map.t Incr.t =
  <fun>
```

Again, we're using incremental functions, but there's no real
incrementality here, since `filter_key_by_string` is just being rerun
from scratch every time the model changes in any way.  The use of
`return` here is a dead giveaway -- you almost never use `return` in
Incremental, since it creates a new incremental node that can't be
efficiently compared to any previous incremental node. That means you
get the overhead of Incremental with none of its benefits.


If you want to get the right incrementality, you instead need to
project out the components of the model individually, and feed them to
`filter_key_by_string`, as follows.

```ocaml
# let filter_model m =
    filter_key_by_string (m >>| data) (m >>| pattern)
val filter_model :
  model Incr.t -> (string, int, String.comparator_witness) Map.t Incr.t =
  <fun>
```

## Be wary of physical equality and cutoffs

Sometimes, we build calculations whose performance depends critically
on whether a given node cuts off.  Unfortunately, the fact that
cutoffs use physical equality can make this tricky to think about.

Here's an example, based on the `index_by` function we wrote in
[Part 3](./part3-map.mdx).  Here's the function as it appeared
there:

```ocaml
# let index_by inner_comparator outer_comparator map get_outer_index =
    let add ~key ~data acc =
      let idx = get_outer_index data in
      Map.update acc idx ~f:(function
        | None -> Map.empty inner_comparator
        | Some inner_map -> Map.set inner_map ~key ~data)
    in
    let remove ~key ~data acc =
      let idx = get_outer_index data in
      Map.update acc idx ~f:(function
        | None -> assert false
        | Some inner_map -> Map.remove inner_map key)
    in
    Incr_map.unordered_fold
      map
      ~init:(Map.empty outer_comparator)
      ~add
      ~update:(fun ~key ~old_data:_ ~new_data:data -> add ~key ~data)
      ~remove
val index_by :
  ('a, 'b) Map.comparator ->
  ('c, 'd) Map.comparator ->
  ('a, 'e, 'f) Map.t Incr.t ->
  ('e -> 'c) -> ('c, ('a, 'e, 'b) Map.t, 'd) Map.t Incr.t = <fun>
```

One thing you might notice about this function is that it doesn't
strictly speaking need to take both comparators as arguments. In
particular, the inner comparator will typically be the same as the
comparator for the input map, since they both use the same type of key
(the polymorphic type `'a` in the above.)

We can fix this by grabbing the comparator from the map directly,
using `Map.comparator_s`.

```ocaml
# let index_by outer_comparator map get_outer_index =
    let%bind inner_comparator = map >>| Map.comparator_s in
    let add ~key ~data acc =
      let idx = get_outer_index data in
      Map.update acc idx ~f:(function
        | None -> Map.empty inner_comparator
        | Some inner_map -> Map.set inner_map ~key ~data)
    in
    let remove ~key ~data acc =
      let idx = get_outer_index data in
      Map.update acc idx ~f:(function
        | None -> assert false
        | Some inner_map -> Map.remove inner_map key)
    in
    Incr_map.unordered_fold
      map
      ~init:(Map.empty outer_comparator)
      ~add
      ~update:(fun ~key ~old_data:_ ~new_data:data -> add ~key ~data)
      ~remove
val index_by :
  ('a, 'b) Map.comparator ->
  ('c, 'd, 'e) Map.t Incr.t ->
  ('d -> 'a) -> ('a, ('c, 'd, 'e) Map.t, 'b) Map.t Incr.t = <fun>
```

This looks reasonable on its face: the comparator of a map can never
change, after all.  That's because each instance of a comparator has a
fresh type, so two comparators with the same type must be the same.

Or at least, they must be logically the same; but they needn't be the
same physical object.  It turns out that `Map.comparator_s` allocates
a new first-class module to wrap the comparator in, so different calls
to `Map.comparator_s` yield different heap-allocated objects.

As a result, the above function has been horrifically de-optimized,
and is now even worse than a simple all-at-once version of the
computation, since in addition to doing the core computation from
scratch on every change, it also allocates some unnecessary
incrementals.

FWIW, we can make this function work by forcing in a cutoff that
reflects the fact that the comparator can't actually change.

```ocaml
# let index_by outer_comparator map get_outer_index =
    let comparator = map >>| Map.comparator_s in
    (* Safe because comparators are uniquely determined by their type *)
    Incr.set_cutoff comparator (Incr.Cutoff.of_equal (fun _ _ -> true));
    let%bind inner_comparator = comparator in
    let add ~key ~data acc =
      let idx = get_outer_index data in
      Map.update acc idx ~f:(function
        | None -> Map.empty inner_comparator
        | Some inner_map -> Map.set inner_map ~key ~data)
    in
    let remove ~key ~data acc =
      let idx = get_outer_index data in
      Map.update acc idx ~f:(function
        | None -> assert false
        | Some inner_map -> Map.remove inner_map key)
    in
    Incr_map.unordered_fold
      map
      ~init:(Map.empty outer_comparator)
      ~add
      ~update:(fun ~key ~old_data:_ ~new_data:data -> add ~key ~data)
      ~remove
val index_by :
  ('a, 'b) Map.comparator ->
  ('c, 'd, 'e) Map.t Incr.t ->
  ('d -> 'a) -> ('a, ('c, 'd, 'e) Map.t, 'b) Map.t Incr.t = <fun>
```

This is still a little slower than the initial version, since every
time `map` changes, the incremental for the comparator will refire,
and `Map.comparator_s` will be re-run again. But the computation will
short-circuit there, and won't lead to a new call to
`Incr_map.unordered_fold`.
