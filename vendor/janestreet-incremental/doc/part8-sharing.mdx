# Incremental tutorial, Part 8; Sharing sub-computations

When building a complex incremental computation, you'll often find
that there are intermediate computations that are useful for multiple
different parts of the overall computation being done.

One example of where this can come up is in building a user-interface
that presents a sorted and filtered view of a given data set.
Multiple different operations may depend on that same
sorted-and-filtered view of the data.  The graphical view that's
presented to the user obviously depends on what data is filtered out
and the order in which the remaining data is sorted.

Somewhat less obviously, updating the state of the application can
depend on that very same data.  In particular, imagine such an app has
a keyboard UI that allows someone to hit a key to move the focus from
one row of data to the next.  Simply figuring out what the next row is
requires access to the filtered and sorted view of the data.  As such,
we have two very different computations that want to share the same
sub-computation.

# Sharing with incremental denormalization

The need to share computations doesn't only come up in user
interfaces.  It can come up in almost any context where you want to
maintain multiple views of the same data for the purpose of making
certain operations more efficient.

This is effectively what happens in databases, where the database is
responsible for incrementally maintaining indices and views that are
derived from your core data model.  In this example, we'll show how
some concepts from databases, particularly the notion of a
*normalized* vs a *denormalized* representation come into play.

First, let's introduce some types for representing orders and
executions.

```ocaml
open Core
module Dir = struct
  type t = Buy | Sell
end
module Symbol : Identifiable = String
module Order = struct
  module Id : Identifiable = String
  type t = { price: float
           ; size : int
           ; symbol: Symbol.t
           ; order_id : Id.t
           ; dir: Dir.t
           }
end
module Exec = struct
  module Id : Identifiable = String
  type t = { id: Id.t
           ; price: float
           ; size: int
           ; oid: Order.Id.t
           }
end
```

Our goal is to compute two things:

- the open interest of the orders (i.e., the sum over all orders of
  the price times the size remaining on the order);
- for each symbol, the number of executed shares.

We'll assume that the input to our computation is the set of open
orders indexed by order id and executions indexed by execution id.
We'll reify this in our model type below:

```ocaml
module Model = struct
  type t =
    { orders : Order.t Map.M(Order.Id).t
    ; execs : Exec.t Map.M(Exec.Id).t
    }
  [@@deriving fields]
end
```

Both calculations will require associating execs with orders, so let's
start by writing a function to do just that.  We're also going to need
the `index_by` operation we introduced in [Part 3](./part3-map.mdx),
so we'll recapitulate that here.


```ocaml
module Incr = Incremental.Make ()
module Incr_map = Incr_map.Make (Incr)
open Incr.Let_syntax;;
```

```ocaml
# let index_by inner_comparator outer_comparator map get_outer_index =
    let add ~key ~data acc =
      let idx = get_outer_index data in
      Map.update acc idx ~f:(function
        | None -> Map.empty inner_comparator
        | Some inner_map -> Map.set inner_map ~key ~data)
    in
    let remove ~key ~data acc =
      let idx = get_outer_index data in
      Map.update acc idx ~f:(function
        | None -> assert false
        | Some inner_map -> Map.remove inner_map key)
    in
    Incr_map.unordered_fold
      map
      ~init:(Map.empty outer_comparator)
      ~add
      ~update:(fun ~key ~old_data:_ ~new_data:data -> add ~key ~data)
      ~remove
val index_by :
  ('a, 'b) Map.comparator ->
  ('c, 'd) Map.comparator ->
  ('a, 'e, 'f) Map.t Incr.t ->
  ('e -> 'c) -> ('c, ('a, 'e, 'b) Map.t, 'd) Map.t Incr.t = <fun>

# let orders_and_execs model =
    let execs_by_oid =
      index_by
        (module Exec.Id)
        (module Order.Id)
        (model >>| Model.execs)
        (fun (exec : Exec.t) -> exec.oid)
    in
    Incr_map.merge (model >>| Model.orders) execs_by_oid ~f:(fun ~key:_ change ->
      match change with
      | `Left order -> Some (Some order, Map.empty (module Exec.Id))
      | `Right execs -> Some (None, execs)
      | `Both (order, execs) -> Some (Some order, execs))
val orders_and_execs :
  Model.t Incr.t ->
  (Order.Id.t,
   Order.t option * (Exec.Id.t, Exec.t, Exec.Id.comparator_witness) Map.t,
   Order.Id.comparator_witness)
  Map.t Incr.t = <fun>
```

Note that in writing the above code, we had to acknowledge the fact
that the data model allows for there to be executions with no
corresponding orders.

Now, let's go ahead and compute the open interest.  Here, we'll simply
assume that executions with no orders have no associated open
interest.

```ocaml
# let open_interest model =
    let orders_and_execs = orders_and_execs model in
    let open_by_oid =
      Incr_map.mapi' orders_and_execs ~f:(fun ~key:_ ~data:order_and_execs ->
        let total_exec_size =
          let change op ~key:_ ~data:(exec : Exec.t) acc = op acc exec.size in
          Incr_map.unordered_fold
            (order_and_execs >>| snd)
            ~init:0
            ~add:(change ( + ))
            ~remove:(change ( - ))
        in
        let%map total_exec_size = total_exec_size
        and maybe_order = order_and_execs >>| fst in
        match maybe_order with
        | None -> 0.
        | Some order ->
          (* Assume all prices are in the same currency.
             Not a good idea in real life. *)
          order.price *. Float.of_int (order.size - total_exec_size))
    in
    let change op ~key:_ ~data:x acc = op acc x in
    Incr_map.unordered_fold open_by_oid ~add:(change ( +. )) ~remove:(change ( -. ))
val open_interest : Model.t Incr.t -> init:float -> float Incr.t = <fun>
```

And the following function will compute the number of shares executed
per symbol, leaning on the same `orders_and_execs` function.

```ocaml
# let executed_shares_by_symbol model =
    let symbols_and_num_execs =
      orders_and_execs model
      |> Incr_map.filter_mapi ~f:(fun ~key:_ ~data:(maybe_order, execs) ->
        match maybe_order with
        | None ->
          (* Drop execs with no order.  In real life, we should report an error. *)
          None
        | Some order -> Some (order.symbol, Map.length execs))
    in
    let change op ~key:_ ~data:(symbol, num_execs) acc =
      Map.update acc symbol ~f:(fun old_num ->
        op (Option.value ~default:0 old_num) num_execs)
    in
    Incr_map.unordered_fold
      symbols_and_num_execs
      ~init:(Map.empty (module Symbol))
      ~add:(change ( + ))
      ~remove:(change ( - ))
val executed_shares_by_symbol :
  Model.t Incr.t -> (Symbol.t, int, Symbol.comparator_witness) Map.t Incr.t =
  <fun>
```

The problem is that, if we need to run both of these computations
concurrently, we're effectively going to duplicate the
`orders_and_execs` computation.

We can fix this by just computing `orders_and_execs` once, and pass it
to both functions.  One idiom for doing this is to create a type that
contains a version of your data that is *denormalized*, to steal a
term from the database world.  i.e., we might have a type like this:

```ocaml
module Enriched_model = struct
  type t =
    { orders_and_execs :
        (Order.t option * Exec.t Map.M(Exec.Id).t) Map.M(Order.Id).t
    ; execs : Exec.t Map.M(Exec.Id).t
    } [@@deriving fields]
end
```

This way of representing the data contains redundancies, since
executions are represented twice: once indexed by order id, and once
indexed by execution id.  This kind of representation can be more
efficient, since it allows data to be looked up efficiently multiple
different ways.

The downside of such denormalized representations is that they can be
error prone: if you're updating it directly, then it's easy to make
changes in one part of the data structure without remembering to
update the other.  But when we derive the enriched model above
directly (and incrementally) from a normalized model without such
redundancies, then we get much of the benefit of both worlds.

Here's a function that does just that.

```ocaml
# let derive_enriched_model model =
    let%map orders_and_execs = orders_and_execs model
    and execs = model >>| Model.execs in
    { Enriched_model.orders_and_execs; execs }
val derive_enriched_model : Model.t Incr.t -> Enriched_model.t Incr.t = <fun>
```

Now, it's straightforward to rewrite `open_interest` and
`executed_shares_by_symbol` to take the `Enriched_model.t` as their
input, at which point they don't need to separately recompute
`orders_and_execs`.

# Sharing with memoization

Denormalization is one way of sharing computations, but it's not the
only one.  Denormalization works well when there's a bounded number of
alternate views of your data that you know in advance, and you can
just go ahead and create them eagerly.

But sometimes, there are a large number of potential views for you to
compute, and the full universe of possibilities is hard to predict in
advance; but at the same time, in practice you're going to need to
reuse the same computation many times.

When this happens, a good approach is memoization.  Incremental has a
number of built-in memoization functions, but we're going to just look
at how to use one of them:

```ocaml
# let _ = Incr.weak_memoize_fun_by_key
- : ?initial_size:int ->
    'a Base.Hashtbl.Key.t ->
    ('b -> 'a) -> ('b -> 'c Heap_block.t) -> ('b -> 'c Heap_block.t) Staged.t
= <fun>
```

The way this works is you give it a function whose input is
hashable and whose output is a heap block.  It will then give you a
new function with the same signature, but that always returns the same
heap block, as long as that heap block is still allocated somewhere.

This function takes advantage of *weak pointers*, which provide for a
nice memory management story.  In particular, weak pointers don't
prevent the values they point to from being collected.  As a result,
this function maintains a cache that will remain populated only so
long as the incremental computations in question remain in use.
Anything that isn't otherwise in use will eventually be collected, and
then on stabilization, the keys in the table with no data will be
cleared out.

Now let's see how we can put this to use.  First, we'll write down
some functions for computing the cashflow associated with a given
symbol. (The cashflow of a trade is the amount of money you spend or
receive on a given trade.)

This first function computes the cashflow given a direction and a map
of executions.

```ocaml
# let cashflow dir execs =
    let%map sign =
      match%map (dir : Dir.t Incr.t) with
      | Buy -> -1.
      | Sell -> 1.
    and cash =
      let change op ~key:_ ~data:(exec : Exec.t) acc =
        op acc (exec.price *. Float.of_int exec.size)
      in
      Incr_map.unordered_fold execs ~init:0. ~add:(change ( +. )) ~remove:(change ( -. ))
    in
    sign *. cash
val cashflow : Dir.t Incr.t -> ('a, Exec.t, 'b) Map.t Incr.t -> float Incr.t =
  <fun>
```

This next function takes an enriched model and a symbol, and filters
down to the symbol in question, and then computes the cashflow for each
order for that symbol, and finally sums those cashflows all together.

```ocaml
# let per_symbol_cashflow (m : Enriched_model.t Incr.t) symbol =
    let cashflow_by_oid =
      Incr_map.filter_mapi
        (m >>| Enriched_model.orders_and_execs)
        ~f:(fun ~key:_ ~data:(maybe_order, execs) ->
          match maybe_order with
          | None -> None (* we ignore execs without symbols, which isn't really right *)
          | Some order ->
            if Symbol.( = ) symbol order.symbol then Some (order, execs) else None)
      |> Incr_map.mapi' ~f:(fun ~key:_ ~data ->
        let%pattern_bind { dir; _ }, execs = data in
        cashflow dir execs)
    in
    let change op ~key:_ ~data acc = op acc data in
    Incr_map.unordered_fold
      cashflow_by_oid
      ~init:0.
      ~add:(change ( +. ))
      ~remove:(change ( -. ))
val per_symbol_cashflow : Enriched_model.t Incr.t -> Symbol.t -> float Incr.t =
  <fun>
```

Now, if you just naively call `per_symbol_cashflow` multiple times
with the same symbol, it will do all that work multiple times.  But we
can use `weak_memoize_fun_by_key` to create a version of the function
that always returns the same incremental value for the same symbol.

We're going to package this together in a module, so that the enriched
model in question is tied together with the function for computing
per-symbol cashflows.

```ocaml
# module Model_with_memo = struct
    type t =
      { model : Enriched_model.t Incr.t
      ; per_symbol_cashflow : Symbol.t -> float Incr.t
      }

    let create model =
      let per_symbol_cashflow =
        Incr.weak_memoize_fun
          (module Symbol)
          (fun symbol ->
             (* This will never fail, because an incremental is guaranteed to be a heap
                block *)
             Heap_block.create_exn (per_symbol_cashflow model symbol))
        |> unstage
      in
      (* We use this coercion to get the type-system to forget that we're returning a heap
         block. *)
      let per_symbol_cashflow = (per_symbol_cashflow :> Symbol.t -> float Incr.t) in
      { model; per_symbol_cashflow }
  end
module Model_with_memo :
  sig
    type t = {
      model : Enriched_model.t Incr.t;
      per_symbol_cashflow : Symbol.t -> float Incr.t;
    }
    val create : Enriched_model.t Incr.t -> t
  end
```

One thing to note is that weak pointers basically don't work in
JavaScript, so if you run this kind of code in the browser you'll find
that it leaks memory.
