(* This test verifies that [Command] satisfies the [Applicative.Let_syntax] interface for
   some value of [Open_on_rhs].

   We test this externally rather than by modifying [command.mli] because [command.mli]
   has lots of module types that we would have to restructure significantly in order to
   get a candidate for [Open_on_rhs_intf].

   Instead, we just punt on saying exactly what [Open_on_rhs] contains and make sure
   [Command] satisfies the remainder of the [Applicative.Let_syntax] interface.
