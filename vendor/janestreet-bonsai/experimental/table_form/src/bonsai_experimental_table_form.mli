(** Builds a table where each row in the table is built out of the constituent form
    elements for a record built from the ['a Form.t Computation.t] parameter.

    Adding a new row is done by filling out a textbox with the sexp-representation of that
    key and either pressing [ENTER] or hitting the "+" button.

    Removing a row is done by hitting the [x] button in that rows "key" column.

    You also need to pass the names for the columns in the same order as they would have
