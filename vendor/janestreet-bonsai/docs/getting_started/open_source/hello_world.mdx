Most OCaml programs result in an .exe file that you run via the
command line. But Bonsai uses
[js_of_ocaml](https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml) to produce a
Javascript file with the extension `.bc.js` (the "bc" for "bytecode")
that is then included in an HTML page.

To see this in action, let's walk through the process of running the
simple example in ../../../examples/hello_world.

## Step 1: The build

Follow the Dune instructions for [building javascript
executables](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jsoo.html)

Once you mark a library or executable with `js_of_ocaml`, you are in
effect declaring that your only dependencies will also be
`js_of_ocaml`-compatible libraries. In particular, you're disallowed
from using libraries that won't work in a Javascript runtime, like
Core or Async--instead, you have to use their non-Unix versions
Core\_kernel and Async\_kernel.

## Step 2: The HTML scaffold

Remember that Bonsai emits a Javascript file with your app's logic. To
get this Javascript to run, we have to include it on the HTML page
that will ultimately be served to your browser. We do that by putting
a `<script>` tag in the HTML page's source:

<!-- If the contents of this change, consider updating the doc! -->
```sh
$ cat ../../../examples/hello_world/index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Hello, Bonsai!</title>
        <script defer src="main.bc.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="app"></div>
    </body>
</html>
```

Notice that "app" `<div>`. That's where Bonsai will "attach" itself,
i.e., that is the element that you will be putting under Bonsai's
control. You'll see in a minute how this is wired up.

## Step 3: Start the server

For this example you can start any old HTML server. Here's an easy
way:

```sh skip
$ cd lib/bonsai/examples/hello_world; python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

**Note:** Once you start the server, you don't need to restart it
whenever you make changes. Instead, the javascript file will be
recompiled by Jenga, and when you reload the web page, the browser
fetches the new copy.

## Step 4: Walking through the code

How do the words "hello world" get on the page? Let's look at the
code.

<!-- If the contents of this change, consider updating the doc! -->
```sh
$ cat ../../../examples/hello_world/main.ml
open! Core
open! Bonsai_web

let component = Bonsai.const (Vdom.Node.text "hello world")

let (_ : _ Start.Handle.t) =
  Start.start Start.Result_spec.just_the_view ~bind_to_element_with_id:"app" component
;;
```

The component is a `Vdom.Node.t
Bonsai_web.Future.Computation.t` constructed with the simplest
possible constructor, `Bonsai.const`, which simply returns as a result
whatever it's passed.

It's bound to the "app" in our HTML page via that
`bind_to_element_with_id` param.

Since this is the top-level component of the app, and since we used
the `Start.Result_spec.just_the_view` "result spec", that result has
to be a `Vdom.Node.t`. A Vdom node could contain a deeply nested tree
full of elements and callbacks; but in this case, it's just the single
text node with the contents "hello world". (Just about every branch of
the DOM on any web page bottoms out in a text node or image.)

That's it!
